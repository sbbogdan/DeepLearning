### DeepLearning

##### Overview
Deep Learning jupyter notebook and code samples created as part of, and post, my participation in [Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program. I highly recommend the course (*caveat: it can be quite time consuming*). 

I generally have tried to match every sample provided here with Tensorflow also with Keras. I am using this space to reinforce my understanding of the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, as well as Deep Learning concepts. 

##### Organization
This directory is organized as follows:
- **SimpleXOR**: Simple XOR implementations using both TensorFlow and Keras.
